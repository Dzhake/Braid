First, you need to put your `.ogg` file in `your_universe/music/` or `your_uinverse/sounds/` (doesn't matter).

Each level has `Issued Sound` entity, which is always invisible. But you can find it using `List All` button on `entities panel`. Or sometimes pressing `Sanity` button works too.

Input your song's name in `sound_name` field of `Issued Sound`, and it should work.
