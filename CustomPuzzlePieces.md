To create custom images for puzzles create `pieces/` folder in your universe's `data/` folder, then copypaste there `puzzle2_page_0.dds` from `Braid/data/pieces/`.

X in `puzzle<X>_page_0.dds` should match world, puzzle for which you want to edit.

You need to open that file somehow. I used GIMP, probably Photoshop support `.dds` files too.

Then you just edit it. Yes, that's annoying. Good luck.

If I remember correctly puzzles have a very tiny bit different sizes (+- 5 pixels).

All puzzle pieces of world 6 puzzle stacked next to each other result an 644x484 image.
