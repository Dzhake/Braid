Some mods have custom pieced images (bg/fg non-collidable deco). I've never done those myself, but I'll try to explain what I see in some mods.

<universe>/data/ contains "pieces" folder with .jpg images, and a "alpha" subfolder with .jpg images with same names, but only black/white, probably indicating, well, alpha (opacity), where full white means fully visible and black means invisible.

"pieces" folder also contains an .pi_set file. [About Pi Set files (TODO)](AboutPiSetFiles(TODO).md).
